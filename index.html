					 <h2>The most beautiful night in Iceland</h2>
					 <p>After days of cold, cloud and rain we packed up for our last night in Iceland. We had come to meet Aurora but as many will know it’s not guaranteed. 
                     There had been nothing more than a hint of green in the sky for 6 days. But some of the most beautiful things in life happen when we least expect it. </p>
